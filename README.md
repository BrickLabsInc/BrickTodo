# Todo Application Modification

## Goals

- Add a feature to an existing environment
- Work within an unfamiliar codebase
- Planning of new features

## Requirements

- Internet connection
- NodeJS 14+
- Your IDE of preference

## Challenge Description

We have a simple react based todo app living in the `./frontend` folder, we would like for you to take this existing todo app and add a backend to it, will need to add routes for saving the todos, fetching the todos, deleting the todos and marking todos as complete. The backend that is created does not need to be hooked up to a database, feel free to use any method desired to save the list data.

The backend code should live in the `./backend/` folder. Backend language should be something you are comfortable with. 

The frontend code will need to be modified for this new state saving feature.

## Installation

- navigate to the `./frontend/` folder
- run `npm install` in a terminal window
- run `npm start` to launch a local frontend instance
  - frontend instance runs at `localhost:3000`
